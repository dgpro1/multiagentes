# Self-hosting OpenLivery

> Leer en español: [self-hosting.md](../es/self-hosting.md)

Run and operate your own OpenLivery instance. For a feature overview see the
[README](../../README.md).

OpenLivery is orchestrated by Docker Compose, with a `Makefile` wrapping the
common commands. A lightweight **gateway** (Caddy) is the single public entry
point: it serves the app and routes `/api/*` to the backend, so the frontend and
API share one origin.

| Service | Image | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `proxy` | Caddy | HTTP gateway — the app's single origin (routes `/api/*` → backend). |
| `web` | Next.js | Agency dashboard, client portal, playground, widget (internal). |
| `api` | FastAPI | REST API, models, AI/knowledge/provider services (internal). |
| `db` | PostgreSQL | All data (encrypted secrets at rest, internal). |
| `evolution` | Evolution API | WhatsApp QR driver (Baileys, internal; own Postgres and Redis). |

Only the gateway is meant to be public. For HTTPS, put your own reverse proxy in
front of it (see [Go to production](#go-to-production-https)). One instance =
**one agency** (the first registered user is its admin). WhatsApp QR is
optional: without `EVOLUTION_API_URL`/`EVOLUTION_API_KEY` set, the rest of the
app works and WhatsApp QR is simply unavailable.

> **Why Caddy for the gateway?** The routing is deliberately simple — two
> upstreams and one rule (`/api/*` → backend, everything else → frontend) — and
> authentication lives in the API (JWT in an httpOnly cookie), not at the edge. A
> single small binary with a tiny config fits that; heavier programmable gateways
> (Envoy, Kong) earn their keep with many services and edge auth/key validation,
> which this stack does not need. The gateway is isolated to the `proxy` service,
> so swapping it later touches nothing else.

## Before you begin

You need the following tools on the host:

- macOS / Windows — [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- Linux / a server — Docker Engine with the Compose plugin.
- Git, GNU Make, a POSIX-compatible shell and OpenSSL.

The commands in this guide are written for a POSIX-compatible shell. On Windows,
run them from WSL or Git Bash rather than PowerShell. Python, Node.js, Go and
PostgreSQL run inside the containers and do not need to be installed on the host
for this installation path.

Check the prerequisites before continuing:

```bash
git --version
docker --version
docker compose version
make --version
sh -c 'echo POSIX shell: $0'
openssl version
```

For a public deployment you also need a **domain** and a server with ports
**80** and **443** open (see [Go to production](#go-to-production-https)).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarrazola/openlivery.git
cd openlivery
./scripts/generate-docker-env.sh   # writes .env.docker with random secrets (gitignored)
make up                            # build, start, run migrations
```

`make up` builds the images, starts the containers, creates the database and
applies the Alembic migrations. Every service should report `healthy`:

```bash
make ps
```

Override host ports inline when they clash with other services:

```bash
API_PORT=8001 WEB_PORT=3001 DB_PORT=5433 make up
```

### Run from prebuilt images (no local build)

Tagged images are published to the GitHub Container Registry on every push to
`main`, so a server can skip building and pull them instead:

```bash
make pull        # docker compose pull + up -d
```

This pulls `ghcr.io/sarrazola/openlivery-{api,web,whatsapp}:latest`. Pin a release
with `OPENLIVERY_VERSION=v1.2.3 make pull`, or point at your own registry with
`OPENLIVERY_IMAGE_PREFIX`. The prebuilt `web` image calls the API through the
gateway with relative `/api`; to target an API on a separate origin you must
build the frontend yourself with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set.

## Access your install

- **App / dashboard** — http://localhost:3000 (the gateway)
- **API docs** — http://localhost:8000/docs (the API is exposed locally for tooling)
- **PostgreSQL** — `make shell-db` (or connect to `localhost:5432`)

On the first screen choose **Create agency**; that account is the admin. Only the
gateway is meant to be reachable publicly; the web, API, database and Evolution
API stay on the private Compose network.

## Secure your install

Do this before exposing OpenLivery to anyone else.

- **Secrets.** `generate-docker-env.sh` fills `SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `WHATSAPP_BRIDGE_TOKEN`, `EVOLUTION_API_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with
  random values. If you set them by hand, use long random strings and never
  reuse them across installs.
- ⚠️ **`ENCRYPTION_KEY` must never change** once secrets are stored — it decrypts
  the provider API keys and the WhatsApp session markers. Losing or changing it
  makes them unrecoverable.
- **Keep services private.** Leave `BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1` (the default) so the
  database, API and frontend are only reachable from the host; expose the app to
  the internet **only** through the reverse proxy (next section). Never publish
  the PostgreSQL port on a public interface.
- **Do not commit `.env.docker`** or any backup that contains it; store it in a
  secret manager.
- Provider API keys are encrypted at rest and never returned in full to the
  browser; the WhatsApp session marker and QR are encrypted too. `WHATSAPP_BRIDGE_TOKEN`
  authenticates the API's internal `/internal/whatsapp` endpoints — do not reuse it as a password or key.
- **Rate limiting.** Public, unauthenticated endpoints are throttled per client
  IP: sign-in and sign-up (agency and portal) to blunt brute force, and the web
  widget's message endpoint because each call spends LLM tokens. Limits are
  in-memory (fine for one instance); set `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false` if a proxy in
  front already enforces limits, or add proxy-level limits for a scaled setup. The
  limiter reads the client from `X-Forwarded-For`, which the gateway sets.

## Go to production (HTTPS)

The stack serves plain HTTP on the gateway. For a public deployment, put **your
own reverse proxy** (Caddy, nginx, Traefik, a cloud load balancer…) in front of
the gateway to terminate TLS with your domain — the usual self-hosting model.

1. Run the stack; the gateway listens on `${WEB_PORT}` (default `3000`), bound to
   `127.0.0.1`.
2. Point your reverse proxy at `127.0.0.1:${WEB_PORT}` and serve your domain over
   HTTPS. Because the app and API share one origin, proxy the **whole domain** to
   that single port — there is nothing else to route.
3. Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in `.env.docker` and restart, so the session cookie
   is only sent over TLS.

Example with Caddy (automatic HTTPS) running on the host:

```caddyfile
agency.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
}
```

Keep the database, API and Evolution API private (`BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1`, the
default); only your reverse proxy should face the internet.

## Custom domains for client portals

By default a client's portal lives at `your-domain/portal/<slug>`. You can also
serve it under the **client's own domain** (e.g. `chat.brand.com`) for a fully
white-label experience. This is opt-in because it requires the gateway to
terminate TLS and obtain certificates on demand.

**1. Enable the multi-domain gateway.** Create a `docker-compose.override.yml`
next to `docker-compose.yml` (Compose merges it automatically):

```yaml
services:
  proxy:
    volumes:
      - ./docker/Caddyfile.ondemand:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro
      - caddy_data:/data          # persist issued certificates across restarts
    environment:
      PRIMARY_DOMAIN: app.youragency.com   # your main domain
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"

volumes:
  caddy_data:
```

Point `app.youragency.com` (and every client domain) at this server, then
`make up`. The gateway obtains a certificate for the primary domain normally, and
for each client domain **on demand** — but only after asking the API whether that
domain is a verified portal domain (`/api/public/portal-domain`), so it never
issues certificates for arbitrary hosts aimed at your IP.

**2. Add the domain for a client.** In the dashboard open the client → **Portal**
tab → **Custom domain**, enter the domain and save. Create the two DNS records it
shows:

| Type | Host | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CNAME` | `chat.brand.com` | your gateway host (e.g. `app.youragency.com`) |
| `TXT` | `_openlivery-challenge.chat.brand.com` | the token shown |

Click **Verify**. Once the TXT record is found the domain is marked verified, the
gateway starts issuing its certificate, and the frontend routes the domain to
that client's portal. The portal must be **published** for the domain to serve.

> Without the override the app stays single-origin behind your own reverse proxy,
> and portals are reachable only at `/portal/<slug>`.

## Environment variables

`generate-docker-env.sh` fills the secrets. To set values by hand, copy
`.env.docker.example` to `.env.docker` and replace every `CHANGE_*`.

| Variable | Scope | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Private network | Main PostgreSQL database. |
| `POSTGRES_TEST_DB` | Private network | Isolated database for `pytest`. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Backend | Signs the agency and portal sessions. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Backend / persisted data | Encrypts API keys, the QR and the WhatsApp session marker. **Must not change** after secrets are stored. |
| `WHATSAPP_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | Backend | Authenticates the API's internal `/internal/whatsapp` endpoints. |
| `EVOLUTION_API_URL`, `EVOLUTION_API_KEY` | Backend + Evolution | WhatsApp QR driver. Without both set, WhatsApp QR is simply unavailable. |
| `EVOLUTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `EVOLUTION_WEBHOOK_URL` | Backend + Evolution | Authenticates and routes the Evolution event webhook. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Backend | Origin allowed by CORS (only needed if you serve the API on a separate origin). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Browser / frontend build | Leave empty (default): the browser calls the API through the gateway with relative `/api`. Set it only to point the frontend at an API on a separate origin (baked at build time). |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | Backend | `true` behind HTTPS so the session cookie is only sent over TLS. |
| `COOKIE_SAMESITE` | Backend | `lax` (default); `none` when the frontend and API are on different sites (requires `COOKIE_SECURE=true`). |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_MINUTES` | Backend | Session lifetime. |
| `API_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`, `DB_PORT` | Host | Host ports (defaults `8000` / `3000` / `5432`). |
| `BIND_HOST` | Host | Bind address: `127.0.0.1` (local) or `0.0.0.0` (expose directly). |

## Manage your install

```bash
make logs                 # follow logs from all services (SERVICE=api to filter)
make ps                   # service status
make stop                 # stop containers (keep them)
make start                # start stopped containers
make restart              # restart all services
make migrate              # apply Alembic migrations in the running api container
make shell-api            # shell inside the api container
make shell-db             # psql inside the database
make down                 # stop and remove containers (keeps data volumes)
```

Run `make help` for the full list.

## Persistent data

All state lives in named Docker volumes, so `make down` and upgrades keep it:

| Volume | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `postgres_data` | PostgreSQL: agency data, knowledge PDF bytes, message attachment bytes, logos, encrypted provider keys and WhatsApp session markers. |
| `evolution_postgres_data`, `evolution_redis_data`, `evolution_instances` | Evolution API's own database, cache and instance files (WhatsApp QR session state). |
| `backend_storage` | The API mount at `/app/backend/storage`. Built-in uploads currently use PostgreSQL, so this volume may be empty. Preserve any files an extension or custom deployment places here. |

The `ENCRYPTION_KEY` decrypts the provider API keys and WhatsApp session markers.
**Never change it** once secrets are stored, or they become unrecoverable —
treat it as part of your backup.

## Backups

A complete backup contains **the PostgreSQL dump, the original `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
and any persistent files outside PostgreSQL**. Keep `.env.docker` in a secret
manager so the other installation settings can be recovered too.

Built-in knowledge PDFs (`knowledge_documents.file_data`), message attachments
(`message_attachments.data`), and logos are binary database columns: the dump
already includes their bytes. The `backend_storage` volume is still declared in
Compose and may contain files from extensions or a customized installation.
The procedure below archives it too; an empty archive is normal for an unmodified
installation.

The following commands run from the installation's repository directory. This
helper selects its Compose configuration; the file commands use the **API
service's configured storage mount**, not a guessed Docker volume name:

```bash
dc() { docker compose --env-file .env.docker "$@"; }
```

These commands cover the application database and file storage. Evolution
API's own state â€” its database (`evolution-db`), cache (`evolution-redis`) and
instance files (`evolution_instances` volume) â€” holds the WhatsApp QR
session/pairing state and needs its own backup if you want WhatsApp QR lines
to survive a restore without rescanning; back it up the same way, substituting
the service and volume names.

### Export a consistent backup

Schedule a maintenance window. Stop `api` **before the export**: it writes
application data while running. Also pause any extensions or external writers
that modify the database or files.
Keep them stopped until both exports finish so the database and files describe
the same application state.

```bash
set -eu
umask 077
backup_dir="backups/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
mkdir -p backups
mkdir "$backup_dir"
dc stop api
dc exec -T db sh -c 'pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -Fc' \
  > "$backup_dir/openlivery.dump.partial"
dc run --rm --no-deps -T --entrypoint tar api \
  -czf - -C /app/backend/storage . > "$backup_dir/uploads.tar.gz.partial"
mv "$backup_dir/openlivery.dump.partial" "$backup_dir/openlivery.dump"
mv "$backup_dir/uploads.tar.gz.partial" "$backup_dir/uploads.tar.gz"
dc start api
```

The temporary API container runs only `tar`; it does not start the application
or migrations. If an export fails, do not use the partial backup. Check the error
and explicitly restart the stopped services when it is safe to resume writes.
Copy the completed backup off the server and record the image version or Git
revision it came from, alongside the separately stored original secrets.

### Restore to an explicit target

Run the restore from the **destination installation's** repository directory,
using the matching image version and the original secrets. Point `backup_dir` at
the matching dump and archive. These commands replace data in that destination
PostgreSQL database. Back up an existing destination before continuing.

The upload destination must be empty: the procedure refuses to overlay an archive
onto existing files. Prefer a fresh installation; do not remove another
installation's volume to make this check pass. Download the destination images
before the maintenance window, then prepare its database and storage mount:

```bash
set -eu
backup_dir="backups/REPLACE_WITH_BACKUP_DIRECTORY"
test -s "$backup_dir/openlivery.dump"
test -s "$backup_dir/uploads.tar.gz"
dc stop api whatsapp
dc up -d --wait db
dc create --no-build api
api_container=$(dc ps -aq api)
docker inspect "$api_container" --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{if eq .Destination "/app/backend/storage"}}Upload restore target: {{.Source}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```

Confirm that the displayed storage target and the Compose project are the intended
destination. With writers still stopped, validate the archive and empty target,
then restore both parts. Stop on any error; do not start the API with only one
part restored.

```bash
set -eu
dc run --rm --no-deps -T --entrypoint tar api -tzf - \
  < "$backup_dir/uploads.tar.gz" > /dev/null
dc run --rm --no-deps -T --entrypoint sh api -c \
  'contents=$(find /app/backend/storage -mindepth 1 -print -quit) || exit 1; test -z "$contents" || { echo "Upload target is not empty; restore to an empty destination." >&2; exit 1; }'
dc exec -T db sh -c \
  'pg_restore -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" --clean --if-exists --no-owner --exit-on-error --single-transaction' \
  < "$backup_dir/openlivery.dump"
dc run --rm --no-deps -T --entrypoint tar api \
  -xzf - -C /app/backend/storage < "$backup_dir/uploads.tar.gz"
dc up -d --wait --no-build
```

Check sign-in, restored knowledge documents or attachments, and any restored
volume files before accepting traffic. The
`ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be the original value; replacing it does not repair encrypted
credentials. Rehearse the procedure with harmless files in a disposable local
installation before using it for an actual recovery.

## Upgrade

```bash
git pull
make up        # rebuilds and restarts; your reverse proxy stays in front
```

New images are built and the backend runs `alembic upgrade head` on start, so
schema changes are applied automatically. Take a backup first.

If you upgrade from a version that used the local Go/whatsmeow bridge, the old
WhatsApp sessions cannot be migrated to Evolution API: configure
`EVOLUTION_API_URL`/`EVOLUTION_API_KEY` and reconnect each channel by scanning
its QR once more.

## Uninstall

`make down` removes the containers and network but keeps your data. To delete
**everything** — database, PDFs, keys and WhatsApp sessions in the volumes:

```bash
make destroy   # irreversible
```

## Run without Docker

Requirements: Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+, Go 1.27+, PostgreSQL 14+ running.

```bash
# 1) databases
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE ROLE openlivery LOGIN PASSWORD 'openlivery';"
createdb -O openlivery openlivery
createdb -O openlivery openlivery_test

# 2) env
cp .env.example .env          # then set SECRET_KEY and ENCRYPTION_KEY

# 3) backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt
cd apps/api && alembic upgrade head && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 4) frontend (new terminal)
cd apps/web && npm install && npm run dev
```

For WhatsApp QR lines, run a local Evolution API instance (see its
[documentation](https://docs.evolutionfoundation.com.br)) and set
`EVOLUTION_API_URL`/`EVOLUTION_API_KEY` in `.env` — everything else works
without it. See `.env.example` for the full variable list.

## Connect WhatsApp

1. Open **Clients → the client → Channels → WhatsApp → Configure**.
2. Choose one of that client's agents and click **Connect with QR code**.
3. On the phone: **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked devices → Link a device**, scan
   the QR and wait for **Connected**.

Incoming messages appear in the agency **Inbox** and the client portal. Click
**Take over** to answer as a human (the AI pauses) and **Return to AI** to
resume. Lines reconnect themselves automatically after a restart — no new QR
unless WhatsApp ends the session, the device is unlinked or `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
changes.

## Tests

Inside Docker:

```bash
make test   # backend pytest + rebuild the web validation stage
```

Locally:

```bash
cd apps/api && ../../.venv/bin/pytest -q     # backend (needs the openlivery_test DB)
cd apps/web && npm run lint && npm run build
```

Re-test the migrations from scratch:

```bash
cd apps/api && alembic downgrade base && alembic upgrade head
```

## WhatsApp / Evolution API caveats

Evolution API (Baileys under the hood) connects to the multi-device protocol of
**WhatsApp Web**; the number is linked as an extra device via QR. It is **not**
the official WhatsApp Business Cloud API, and this project is not affiliated
with or endorsed by WhatsApp/Meta.

- WhatsApp may change its protocol or revoke a session/device without notice.
- Abusive automation, spam or mass sending can get a number restricted. Use only
  numbers authorized by each client and respect WhatsApp's terms.
- The QR links the account while valid — never share it or screenshot it publicly.
- The integration handles one-to-one conversations (text, media, documents,
  locations and reactions, plus transcribed voice notes and described images
  when the agent's capabilities are on). Groups need the line's toggle enabled
  (the agent answers only when mentioned or replied to); calls are always
  declined, optionally with an explanation message. Statuses and newsletters
  are ignored.
- One WhatsApp account belongs to one client; another client needs a different
  number.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ports already in use.** Override them inline:
  `API_PORT=8001 WEB_PORT=3001 DB_PORT=5433 make up`.
- **A service is unhealthy.** Check its logs with `make logs SERVICE=api` (or
  `web`, `evolution`, `db`) and `make ps` for status.
- **Session does not persist, or login loops behind HTTPS.** Make sure
  `COOKIE_SECURE=true` is set and you are reaching the app over TLS.
- **Provider keys or the WhatsApp session stopped decrypting.** The
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY` changed — restore the original value from your backup.
- **WhatsApp asks for a new QR after a restart.** Normal only if WhatsApp ended
  the session, the device was unlinked or `ENCRYPTION_KEY` changed; otherwise
  lines reconnect to their Evolution instance automatically.
